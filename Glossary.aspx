    all interest paid on the loan from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2002, is tax deductible. Payments made 
    beginning January 1, 1998 can be deducted on 1998 tax returns filed in 1999. The deduction is limited to $1,000 in 1998, 
    $1,500 in 1999, $2,000 in 2000 and $2,500 thereafter. The interest deduction can not be claimed for any interest 
    amount paid prior to January 1, 1998. The Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Credit will be available as a credit 
    against federal income taxes beginning with 1998 tax returns. We advise you to consult your tax advisor to determine 
    your eligibility for the deduction and tax credits. <a href="#top">[Back to top]</a>
